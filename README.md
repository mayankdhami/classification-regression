# Classification and Regression
The classification dataset contains instances from a research that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago’s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. There were a total of 306 instances recorded, with a pool of four variables namely the following:

Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)
Patient’s year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)
Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)
Survival status (class attribute): 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer, 2 = the patient died within 5 year.

The regression dataset is the market historical data set of real estate valuation, collected from Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan. There are 414 instances of data over seven variables including the following:

X1=the transaction date (for example, 2013.250=2013 March, 2013.500=2013 June, etc.)

X2=the house age (unit: year)

X3=the distance to the nearest Mass Rapid Transit(MRT) station (unit: meter)

X4=the number of convenience stores in the living circle on foot (integer)

X5=the geographic coordinate, latitude. (unit: degree)

X6=the geographic coordinate, longitude. (unit: degree)

Y= house price of unit area (10000 New Taiwan Dollar/Ping, where Ping is a local unit, 1 Ping = 3.3 meter^2)

The variable originally marked as Y was the dependent variable to be predicted.

The datasets are both available on UCI Machine Learning repository.
